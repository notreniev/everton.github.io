            </small>
            <p>In 2010 I did for a public tender to start at a new position as Java Analyst and I passed. In 2011 I arrumed this new position and started working with Java/PHP/Javascript/HTML/CSS in several internal projects for the management area who
                wanted to automatize some process and workflows in the company using Java and Oracle Workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of this workflows were about implementation of ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), in disciplines like Configuration Management, Changing Management, Problems Management and so on.

            <p>
                In 2005 I was invited to join the Technical Operations Team. At this point I was beginning with Java/JSP for software development in one project, but in Technical Operations team I was able to work with many skilled people and many other different projects. In some point I was responsible
                for maintaining 6 Java applications simultaneously, all of them communicating with each other via web services (SOAP and then after a while RESTful).
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time it was a common thing the monolithic architecture and so it was for a while. Meanwhile, I was having a good progression on my career getting promoted each couple of years or so.

            </small>
            <p>
                In March 2000, I became a team member of the Systems Operations Department as Technical Specialist and I was responsible for developing web systems for the company's intranet. By then I used to program a lot in ASP and had to learn more about data modelling
                and some Systems Analysis, providing a huge workflow for this department I was working in.

                </small>
            <p>
                This was my first job with autonomy to take decisions on my own for the departments I was responsible to providing assistance. It brought me a lot of experience not just for working on IT support for school's intranet, network and website development, but also because I was able to work with the clients and their needs.

                </small>
            <p>
                It was where everything started: as a Call center attendant, responsible for IT support for the clients through telephone, working with several areas on public services. I felt very passionate about this at the time brecause it was a huge opportunity. My work was meaningful and I was able to help people wirh their difficulties. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started as an IT Support Attendant guy but I rapdly moved on when I saw myself with the opportunity of getting involved as a developer of the Knowledge Base System for the call center. It was my firt professional experience working with HTML, CSS and Javascript in a time of Internet Explorer 3 x Netscape war. Big time with a lot of cross-browser imcompatibilities.
