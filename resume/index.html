                In 2011, after months in a new position as Java Analyst I was invited to join a mobile/web team where I could work with all the technologies that surround it. My responsibility was research & development for mobile/web projects. That was the early days
                of mobile platforms. Suddenly I wasn't only a Java Analyst, Mobile and Web Developer, but also a researcher too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this position I was able to find new ways to solve software architecture problems, new technologies and different ways to think and solve this problems. In these almost last 9 years on it I was able to work with many different projects which led me
                to work with:
