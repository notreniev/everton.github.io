    <h2>Software Engineer/Developer</h2>
    <div class="box justify">
        <div class="page">
            <p>In 2011 I was invited to be part of the team for mobile projects support where I got the responsibility of making research & development for mobile technologies. I started another fase of my career, this time it was with Android Platform and
                It was quite easy because it was basically, you know: Java. </p>

            <p>But then, the monolithic architecture started to give signs of tiredness and I started do listen what that developers community was buzzing about Non Monolithic Architecture: REST, API, micro-services, Javascript Frameworks like AngularJS.
                Ionic Framework. It was a break changing. Things would never been the same and que old monolithic world was far behind. I started to look with more careful to Javascript. First I learned AngularJS, then Ionic with Cordova, then Angular
                2+ and so on. I started to look at NodeJS, npm and the role universe that it was. And all of it brought me here. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <p>Nowadays I often support the teams in the company who need I consultant and a backup programmer to finish the projects and delivery it on time. I've been working with teams for transit department, water and sewage department, police and security
                department and many others. So, that's my story and I'm proud of it. Probably there's something more that I'm forgeting to tell. But I've got 22 years of IT/mobile/web development and I hope that it speaks for itself. </p>

            <p>I'm flexible, easy going style with 18y+ hands-on software development experience and practical experience working with web and mobile projects, using CI/CD to automate building processes with Jenkins and TFS.</p>
            <p>I'm very capable of working in any team, I'm skilled, specially in javascript using nodeJs and angular, but I'm also experienced in Android and Java. I like front-end and back-end development, I love programming languages and I'm very committed
                self-learning person.
            </p>

            <p>I'd like to work with a creative team in projects that make difference for the clients business value.</p>

        <h2>Technical Specialist</h2>
        <div class="box justify">
            <p>
                In 1998 I started in PROCERGS as a callcenter guy. I used to work receiving phone calls every day. That was just a starting position but was eager for something more. So a few months latter I was invited to do an extra job as a HTML mantainer for the
                knowledge software of the callcenter department I was working with. So, that was the way I started my development career. At first it was with static HTML pages with CSS and just a little Javascript in the Internet Explorer and Netscape
                era. After a while it evolved to Dynamic Web Pages using ASP 3.0 with Access databases for the company Intranet's website (fun stuff). It was really fun, and more I began to learn more I got interested. Later I began to study PHP and loved
                because I used to think it was like C but for web. Web development was always my thing. </p>


            <p>In 2005 I started a Java corse by myself. It was a ruge challenge because I was never used to work with OOP paradigm. It was a shock for me at first. At the same time I began to work maintaining a Java software in the company knowing almost
                nothing about Java. I had just started the course... Even so I kept going and about 6 months later I was ok in Java. More confident and ready for more challenges. It was exciting for me finally being a Java Software Developer. But that
                was just the beginning because Java Platform was yet too big for me. Things kept going and had opportunities of working in several projects, I started in college and in some point I was responsible for maintaining 6 applications at the
                same time, all of them communicating with each other via web services. At the time it was a common thing the monolithic architecture and so it was for a while. I must say that at the time I was getting promoted to some levels in my career
                by each couple of years. And it was nice to be recognised for something I was good at. Something that has started so difficult for me todo and by now I was really comfortable with it. </p>


            <p>In 2010 I applied to a public exam to Java Analyst position at PROCERGS. The time working with Java and the time at college gave me enough knowledge to pass in the exame. It was quite easy. In 2011 I started this new position working with
                Java/PHP/Javascript/HTML/CSS in several intern projects to solve problems for the managers who wanted to make better some of the process and workflow issues in the company. Some of them were about implementation of ITIL (Information Technology
                Infrastructure Library) disciplines like Configuration Management, Changing Management, Problems Management and so on. </p>
